 Pandas
 
Pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.

**Pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:**

Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet
Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.
Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels
Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure

**Pandas is built on top of NumPy and is intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries.**


**Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:**

Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data

Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects

Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations

Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data

Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects

Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets

Intuitive merging and joining data sets

Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets

Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)

Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format

Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging.

Many of these principles are here to address the shortcomings frequently experienced using ot
